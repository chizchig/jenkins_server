Automation server for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## GIT: 
Version control system facilitating efficient source code management.

## Terraform: 
Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure resources.

## Docker: 
Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications via containerization.

## Prometheus: 
Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit for collecting and querying metrics.

## Grafana: 
Multi-platform analytics and monitoring solution for metric visualization.

## Python 3.11: 
Latest version of Python programming language for scripting and automation.

## Kubectl: 
Kubernetes command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

## Minikube: 
Local Kubernetes cluster setup tool for development and testing.

## Setup Instructions
## 1.	Instance Provisioning:
    •	Provision a Super Instance with instance type t2.medium.
    •	Ensure the Super Instance is configured within a 2-tiers network environment.

## 2.	Tool Bootstrapping:

    •       Execute the provided script to bootstrap all tools onto the Super Instance.
    •	Confirm successful installation and configuration of each tool.

## 3.	Configuration and Customization:

    •	Customize configurations for each tool to align with specific requirements.
    •	Establish proper network connectivity and access permissions as needed.

## 4.	Verification and Testing:

    •	Verify the functionality and connectivity of each tool post-installation.
    •	Conduct testing to ensure seamless operation and interoperability.

## Additional Considerations
    • Maintenance and Updates: Regularly update and maintain installed tools for 
        security and performance.
    • Resource Monitoring: Monitor resource utilization on the Super Instance to 
        prevent performance issues.
    • Backup and Recovery: Implement robust backup and recovery strategies for 
        critical 
        data and configurations.
    • Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for reference and 
        troubleshooting.
